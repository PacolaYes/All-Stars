##  (WIP) Story
Eggman has invited _Sonic & Friends_ to star in his TV show to keep people watching cable TV (and for people to waste money in it). The starring show he had planned to rerun into hell isn't enough to get viewers hooked so he has to spice the content up a bit...

## Plans
The current plan is to get a functional build with plain `Co-op` and a remixed `Race` mode
Future plans are to add a _3D_ hub _World_ and lore n' stuff for a single player campaign
