# SpongeBob SquigglePants
SpongeBob SquigglePants (known as SpongeBob SquigglePants 3D on the Nintendo 3DS port), known in Germany as SpongeBob Schwammkopf: Verflixt und Zugemalt (English: SpongeBob SquarePants: Darn and Painted), is an action video game based on the SpongeBob SquarePants series. It is the fourth game to be released in the uDraw Series. The gameplay is inspired by Nintendo's WarioWare series.

The video game was developed by WayForward Technologies and published by THQ. It contains nanogames and mini-games which require using the uDraw GameTablet on the Wii version. A version for the Nintendo 3DS was made later, which added a brand new level, IconBob, which requires the circle pad.

Gameplay
Wii version

Similar to WarioWare games, players get to play mini-games, dubbed Nanogames, in quick succession in order to proceed. Each nanogame has a short time limit of less than 10 or 5 seconds, depending on the nanogame, and players would have to rely on quick thinking and reflexes to finish each nanogame. The game requires the use of the now-discontinued uDraw GameTablet by THQ.
Nintendo 3DS version

The gameplay on the Nintendo 3DS version is almost identical to the Wii version, but the touch screen is used instead of the uDraw Tablet. The IconBob levels (which are exclusive to this version) are done using the Nintendo 3DS Circle Pad.

Reception

The game has received "mixed or average reviews" on both platforms according to review aggregator Metacritic. There was a 59/100 on the Wii version[1] and a 64/100 on the Nintendo 3DS version.[2]

Christopher Healy of Common Sense Media rated it 4 out of 5. Healy warned parents about the cartoon violence in few of the mini-games, but praised the game for its ease of play and messages about art.[3] In a review for USA Today on April 25, 2011, Jinny Gudmundsen awarded the game three out of four stars and said that the game was worthwhile because of its novel gameplay.[4] In Atomic Gamer's review on May 10, 2011, it was awarded an overall score of 6 out of 10 and said that SpongeBob SquigglePants is a great game to showcase this device, especially with the huge number of ways it uses the tablet and even pokes fun at other, more "mature" video games now and then. It won't be terribly engaging for an adult, but this is a fantastic gift for a little SpongeBob fan."

In contrast, Cheat Code Central gave a score of 2.9 out of 5 and criticizing the game's repetitive music and average play value, stating "this mini-game doesn't work at all, most of the games in SpongeBob SquigglePants at least work, but the trouble is that the controls just aren't that intuitive."[5] Dave Rudden of GamePro gave the Nintendo 3DS version 3 stars, stating "THQ and Wayforward Technologies both deserve some credit for making a game that feels as close to a first-party effort as anything seen on the 3DS yet, as SpongeBob SquigglePants is the closest any game has ever come to matching the WarioWare formula. Unfortunately, the game's lack of new ideas, content, and worthwhile 3D effects sap any value out of this sponge."[6]

Cultural references

    The game is similar to the WarioWare games. Both contain minigames that are split into sections, each of the sections on both games contain themes, and a main character associated them, and both games contain lives.
        Also, both WarioWare games and SpongeBob SquigglePants were released exclusively for Nintendo systems.
    When completing a nanogame, the Korg M1 preset "Vibes" plays the same "ding" sound as in older versions of Microsoft Windows.
    Several nanogames contain references to various media, real-world events and songs:
        Sponge Xing is a reference to the 1981 video game Frogger.
        Seavaders is a reference to the 1978 video game Space Invaders.
        The Legend of SpongeBob is a reference to The Legend of Zelda.
        Ping Pong Pals is a reference to the 1972 video game Pong.
        The nanogame Bikini Bottom on Ice's name is based on Disney On Ice.
        Squidward Bound's name is a pun on Homeward Bound.
        Super Krabby Quest is a reference to the final-boss fight in the 1985 video game Super Mario Bros.
        Jelly Alley is a parody of the 1980 arcade game Pac-Man.
            Ironically one of the possible mazes is the same as the original game.
        Pursuit of Planktonness's name is a reference to the 1934 film The Pursuit of Happiness.
        Trash It's name is a pun on Bop It.
        Krabby Patty in Paradise's name is a reference to the 1978 Jimmy Buffett song "Cheeseburger in Paradise".
